    <h1>About the Project</h1>
    <p>
      Greenlight Recruit was created to solve a simple but persistent problem in college golf recruiting:
      coaches spend far too much time jumping between AJGA, Junior Golf Scoreboard, WAGR, spreadsheets,
      emails, and scattered notes. The information exists — but it’s fragmented, inconsistent, and slow
      to work with during the busiest parts of the recruiting cycle.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>Our mission:</strong> Give college golf coaches a single, unified recruiting cockpit that
      consolidates rankings, performance data, and evaluation tools into one clean, modern interface.
    </div>

    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Unify AJGA, Junior Golf Scoreboard, and WAGR data into a single, coach-friendly view.</li>
      <li>Provide meaningful context behind scores — field strength, scoring trends, and event quality.</li>
      <li>Give coaches tools they actually use: shortlists, notes, tags, and exportable reports.</li>
      <li>Reduce time spent searching for information so coaches can focus on evaluating fit.</li>
      <li>Offer juniors and parents clarity on how their data appears and how to keep it accurate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>
      College golf recruiting is increasingly competitive, and coaches are expected to evaluate more
      players across more regions than ever before. Greenlight Recruit helps programs stay organized,
      informed, and efficient — without adding complexity or noise.
    </p>

    <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>College coaches</strong> who want a faster, clearer way to evaluate junior golfers.</li>
      <li><strong>Junior golfers & parents</strong> who want transparency and accuracy in how their data is presented.</li>
      <li><strong>Programs</strong> looking to modernize their recruiting workflow.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This project is still evolving, and new features will continue to be added as coaches provide
      feedback and the junior golf landscape changes.
